# Raspilepsy

This Project provides the both the hardware plans as well as the software used
to build a self running, distributed and mostly patient operated platform to
perform video monitoring of epileptic seizures.

## Installation

`Raspilepsy` currently runs smoothly on a [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), which can run any Linux flavor as operating
system. We have good experience with [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/).

After having installed the OS on your RPi, clone the repository from
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sourceflux/raspilepsy-code) into and arbitrary
directory of your RPi and run `setup.py`:

    sudo python setup.py install

Please bear in mind, that the Raspilepsy is language agnostic towards Python 2.7
and not upwards compatible, yet. This is due to some third party packages that
are used.
